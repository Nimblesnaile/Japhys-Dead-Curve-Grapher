# Japhys-Dead-Curve-Grapher
This program analyzes lifespan data for a group of flies and generates a survival curve. The result is a clear visual representation of the lifespan distribution for the specified genotype or group.

There is no currently only support for data gathered in a fashion exactly like the template. Having no gender/genotype is supported, and as long as fly counts are underneath the labels, the program will produce a graph.
